# TriviaMaze

The Computer Science Trivia Maze will be a Java based application that uses text based
console to generate a GUI for the ease of use from the player. This maze will be an 4x4 square
where the start of the maze is at the top left and end is at the bottom right. To move from “room”
to “room” the player will have to answer a randomly selected question from a SQLite database.
Trivia Maze will be developed using Eclipse as the main IDE.
